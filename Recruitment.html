<h1>Ph.D. and Postdoc Recruitment (<a href="./Recruitment_C.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>中文版本</a>)</h1>
</div>
<h2>Brief Introduction to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)</h2>
<p>Since its establishment in 1991, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has rapidly risen among global universities due to its innovative spirit and progressive philosophy, developing into a research university of international repute. 
The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) (HKUST(GZ)), an independent legal entity formed through collaboration between Mainland China and Hong Kong, is located in the Nansha District of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province. 
Founded in 2022, HKUST(GZ) together with HKUST constitute &ldquo;HKUST 2.0&rdquo;. 
Under the strategic framework of &ldquo;HKUST 2.0&rdquo;, HKUST(GZ) has adopted a new academic structure integrating various disciplines. 
This structure replaces the traditional model of &ldquo;faculties&rdquo; and &ldquo;departments&rdquo; with &ldquo;Hubs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thrusts&rdquo;, aimed at fostering interdisciplinary integration. 
It complements the deep academic foundation of HKUST's Clear Water Bay campus, facilitating resource sharing and synergistic benefits to address complex challenges faced by the world and human society.</p>
<p>In terms of student cultivation, HKUST(GZ) employs English as the medium of instruction, aiming to nurture high-end talent with international perspectives and innovative capabilities, serving the technological innovation and industrial upgrading in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. 
Guided by the principle of &ldquo;One HKUST, complementary campuses&rdquo;, the two campuses collaborate closely, with mutual access to teaching and research facilities, credit recognition for courses, and ensuring consistency in degree certificates and student treatment. 
Masters and doctoral students at HKUST(GZ) will receive their respective degree certificates from HKUST.</p>
